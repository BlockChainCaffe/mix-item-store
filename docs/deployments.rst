BlobStore can be deployed on any Ethereum blockchain. Each blockchain needs a single BlobStoreRegistry to be deployed. This is so that when later versions of BlobStore are deployed they can register with it.

On each blockchain, each BlobStore contract has a serial number that is used outside the blockchain to identify which contract a blob is stored on. This page is the authority on which contracts have which serial numbers on which blockchains.

Each BlobStore contract also has a contractId that is used within contracts.

See :ref:`blobid` for more information.
